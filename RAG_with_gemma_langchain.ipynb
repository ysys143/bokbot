      "These models can be applied on:\n",
      "\n",
      "* 📝 Text, for tasks like text classification, information extraction, question answering, summarization, translation, and text generation, in over 100 languages.\n",
      "* 🖼️ Images, for tasks like image classification, object detection, and segmentation.\n",
      "* 🗣️ Audio, for tasks like speech recognition and audio classification.\n",

      "Transformer models can also perform tasks on **several modalities combined**, such as table question answering, optical character recognition, information extraction from scanned documents, video classification, and visual question answering.\n",
      "\n",
      "🤗 Transformers provides APIs to quickly download and use those pretrained models on a given text, fine-tune them on your own datasets and then share them with the community on our [model hub](https://huggingface.co/models). At the same time, each python module defining an architecture is fully standalone and can be modified to enable quick research experiments.\n",
      "\n",
      "🤗 Transformers is backed by the three most popular deep learning libraries — [Jax](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) — with a seamless integration between them. It's straightforward to train your models with one before loading them for inference with the other.\n",

      "\n",
      "You can test most of our models directly on their pages from the [model hub](https://huggingface.co/models). We also offer [private model hosting, versioning, & an inference API](https://huggingface.co/pricing) for public and private models.\n",

      "The tokenizer is responsible for all the preprocessing the pretrained model expects and can be called directly on a single string (as in the above examples) or a list. It will output a dictionary that you can use in downstream code or simply directly pass to your model using the ** argument unpacking operator.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model itself is a regular [Pytorch `nn.Module`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) or a [TensorFlow `tf.keras.Model`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model) (depending on your backend) which you can use as usual. [This tutorial](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/training) explains how to integrate such a model into a classic PyTorch or TensorFlow training loop, or how to use our `Trainer` API to quickly fine-tune on a new dataset.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Why should I use transformers?\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Easy-to-use state-of-the-art models:\n",
      "    - High performance on natural language understanding & generation, computer vision, and audio tasks.\n",
      "    - Low barrier to entry for educators and practitioners.\n",
      "    - Few user-facing abstractions with just three classes to learn.\n",
      "    - A unified API for using all our pretrained models.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Lower compute costs, smaller carbon footprint:\n",
      "    - Researchers can share trained models instead of always retraining.\n",
      "    - Practitioners can reduce compute time and production costs.\n",
      "    - Dozens of architectures with over 400,000 pretrained models across all modalities.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Choose the right framework for every part of a model's lifetime:\n",
      "    - Train state-of-the-art models in 3 lines of code.\n",
      "    - Move a single model between TF2.0/PyTorch/JAX frameworks at will.\n",
      "    - Seamlessly pick the right framework for training, evaluation, and production.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Easily customize a model or an example to your needs:\n",
      "    - We provide examples for each architecture to reproduce the results published by its original authors.\n",
      "    - Model internals are exposed as consistently as possible.\n",
      "    - Model files can be used independently of the library for quick experiments.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Why shouldn't I use transformers?\n",
      "\n",
      "- This library is not a modular toolbox of building blocks for neural nets. The code in the model files is not refactored with additional abstractions on purpose, so that researchers can quickly iterate on each of the models without diving into additional abstractions/files.\n",
      "- The training API is not intended to work on any model but is optimized to work with the models provided by the library. For generic machine learning loops, you should use another library (possibly, [Accelerate](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate)).\n",
      "- While we strive to present as many use cases as possible, the scripts in our [examples folder](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples) are just that: examples. It is expected that they won't work out-of-the-box on your specific problem and that you will be required to change a few lines of code to adapt them to your needs.\n",
